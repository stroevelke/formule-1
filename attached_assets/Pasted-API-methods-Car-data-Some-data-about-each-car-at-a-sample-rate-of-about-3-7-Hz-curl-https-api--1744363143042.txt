Data filtering
Refine your query by including parameters directly in the URL.
Results can be filtered by any attribute, except arrays.

Example
To fetch pit-out laps for driver number 55 (Carlos Sainz) that last at least 2 minutes, use: https://api.openf1.org/v1/laps?session_key=9222&driver_number=55&is_pit_out_lap=true&lap_duration>=120

Time-Based Filtering
You can narrow down your results using time ranges.

Example
To get all sessions in September 2023, use: https://api.openf1.org/v1/sessions?date_start>=2023-09-01&date_end<=2023-09-30

The API supports a wide range of date formats (those compatible with Python's dateutil.parser.parse method). Examples include:

"2021-09-10"
"2021-09-10T14:30:20"
"2021-09-10T14:30:20+00:00"
"09/10/2021"
"09-10-2021"
"Fri Sep 10 14:30:20 2021"
"10 September 2021"
"Sep 10, 2021"
"2021-09-10 14:30:20 UTC"
"2021-09-10 14:30:20+00:00"
"2021-09-10 14:30:20 EST"
...and many more.
